            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>SCotland</hi> has long been happy by your ſtay,</l>
               <l>But bleſt be God at laſt your come away,</l>
               <l>Now every Church doth eccho with the Bells</l>
               <l>And mirth and Muſick in our City dwels.</l>
               <l>Let the dull Scots lament we ſhall not greive,</l>
               <l>Unleſs your Highneſs doth ſweet <hi>England</hi> leave.</l>
               <l>Your abſence long as bred our diſcontent</l>
               <l>We ow'd our grief to an ill Parliament.</l>
               <l>But they are Seatterd to and fro we find,</l>
               <l>And now Your Foes do prove a little kind.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>York</hi> has no foes but thoſe that lurk in holes,</l>
               <l>And undermind him Secretly like Moles,</l>
               <l>It's true indeed, ſome whigs look ſower and dull,</l>
               <l>And do their hats over their eyebrows pull;</l>
               <l>Some hate your worth and others hate yout Name.</l>
               <l>Some would Eclipſe your vertues and your fame.</l>
               <l>And yet their actions do beget their ſhame.</l>
               <l>But theſe are but the Comrades of the Devil,</l>
               <l>Who call what's evil good, and what's good evil.</l>
               <l>Some ſuch we have whoſe looks are very pale,</l>
               <l>Who at your Royal Actions always raile;</l>
               <l>And yet can hardly tell you what they aile,</l>
               <l>They pine, and fret, look dull, and ſigh, and wrine,</l>
               <l>And hate you cauſe you are the Royal Line;</l>
               <l>They ſigh and mourn, and vex, and wiſh the Thames,</l>
               <l>Might drown the moſt Illuſtrious Highborn <hi>James!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>They do diſpiſe you, yet can give no reaſon,</l>
               <l>Only they would be nibling at high Treaſon.</l>
               <l>Fain would they ſee you fall before the Throne,</l>
               <l>And make new <hi>Noll</hi> fancy the Crown his own.</l>
               <l>They loath good Natur'd <hi>Charls,</hi> and their ſick,</l>
               <l>For want of Rump, old <hi>Oliver</hi> and <hi>Dick.</hi>

               <l>What would theſe ſtubborn Rogues, theſe pious Ceaters</l>
               <l>Give for the ſight of their old friends <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi>

               <l>They would power all their goodneſs, and their Zeal,</l>
               <l>In hopes to gain another common weale.</l>

               <l>And throw good Subjects to the Hangmans paws.</l>
               <l>All this was done ſtill for the good old cauſe.</l>
               <l>When <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt was brought unto the Block,</l>
               <l>And when our peace they did in pieces Knock;</l>
               <l>Still the Tub Preachers theſe accurſt Jack Dawes,</l>
               <l>Cry'd out, it was even for the good old Cauſe.</l>
               <l>Now let their good old Cauſe ſink down to Hell,</l>

               <l>For there's no doubt but every Whig doth know.</l>
               <l>The only Cauſe I doubt muſt come from thoſe,</l>
